This final is the total accumulation of work done throughout the Spring semester for N215. It takes a reference design of Eventsy, and requires students to turn it into a complete project. Navigation must be done using MVC. It also must be mobile responsive. Overall, this was a really great project to test all of the skills I had learned. I actually found it to be rather easy to complete, and I challenged myself to include things like mix-ins and variables to take advantage of SASS. One of the hardest challenges that I had was figuring out how I wanted the items that included dates to appear in mobile view, but I think I ultimately settled on something that works quite well for the overall site. Figuring out how to import the fonts was another small challenge, but I overcame it after browsing through W3Schools documentation.

Enjoy the recreation of eventsy!
